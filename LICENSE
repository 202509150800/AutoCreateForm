## 🤖 AI Development Notice

This project was 100% developed with the assistance of multiple AI models:

### Development Timeline

**Phase 1 (Initial Setup & Problem Diagnosis)**
- Claude Opus 4.5 - Architecture design and initial code structure
- Claude Haiku 4.5 - Supporting implementation and refinement

**Phase 2 (Core Feature Development)**
- Google Gemini 3 - Core algorithm implementation and optimization
- Claude Haiku 4.5 - Code review and quality assurance

**Phase 3 (Documentation & Finalization)**
- Google Gemini 3 - Comprehensive documentation generation
- Claude Haiku 4.5 - Final refinement and optimization

### AI Models Used

| Model | Version | Purpose | Usage |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| Claude | Opus 4.5 | Complex architecture and problem-solving | Phase 1 |
| Claude | Haiku 4.5 | Implementation, refinement, QA | All phases |
| Google Gemini | 3 | Algorithm development and documentation | Phase 2-3 |

### Deliverables Generated with AI Assistance

✅ All source code (server + frontend)
✅ Project structure and architecture
✅ Unit and integration tests
✅ Complete documentation (2500+ lines)
✅ API reference documentation
✅ Best practices guides
✅ Deployment configurations
✅ Bug fixes and optimization

### Development Approach

This project demonstrates a hybrid AI development approach:
- Leveraging different AI models for their specific strengths
- Iterative refinement through multiple AI interactions
- Human oversight and final validation
- Production-ready code quality standards
